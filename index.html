    <h2>SHADOWS WITHIN</h2>
    <pre>
     SHADOWS WITHIN 
How dark is darkness in your heart?
Does it trigger nausea for verbal dehérence?
How twisted are the knots that no gesture can restructure,
grinning at your grace and grooming at others' reach?
Too mean to give a hand, yet eavesdropping keenly waiting for downfall,
built yourself high walls, peeping through the keyhole.

In shadows cast, your secrets dance,
where echoes whisper ancient tales,
of loves lost and betrayals deep,
where trust is but a fleeting breath,
and silence reigns in solemn keep,
beneath the weight of untold truths.

Within the depths, emotions swirl,
like tempests raging in the night,
each wave a tumult of despair,
crashing against the shores of reason,
where dreams dissolve in pools of doubt,
and fears take root in fertile soil.

Yet in the darkness, there is light,
a glimmer of hope, a faint refrain,
that whispers of redemption's touch,
and the promise of a brighter dawn,
where scars may heal and wounds may mend,
and shadows fade into the past.

So let the darkness embrace your soul,
and lead you through the labyrinth,
of your own making, to find the truth,
that lies hidden in the depths within,
for only by confronting your demons,
can you truly find the light.

		<h2>BED Of DECIET</h2>
		<pre>
May the tears she cried over him drown her,
And let the echoes of her bad mouthing deafen her.
All the negative thoughts she harbored about him,
Drive her mind to realms unknown, a whirlwind grim.

As she runs into another's arms, may fate find her,
Breaking legs, stumbling in her hasty blur.
Each lie she told him, now gospel truth to his ear,

A heart once shattered, let it be a distant fear.

A serpent, the least to describe her in this sad song,
Slithering through his thoughts, where she doesn't belong.
Coiled in his mind, blinding his sight so keen,
Your slithering presence, a venomous sheen.

Murmuring and flapping lips of deceit's hue,
Masking lust with words that seem true.

No curse to cast, just a light to shine,
On sins that match, in this twisted design.

Love, a lie spun to fulfill her whims,
Vanished without a trace, when the need brims.
Abandoned in knots, without a goodbye note,
Karma's ledger, I hope it did denote.

Knocking soon, as fate dictates the score,
Just as she left, let it stay forevermore. 


May she learn from the ache she caused,
In the broken pieces, her remorse be paused.
For every wound inflicted, a lesson to impart,
To awaken empathy, within her heart's chart.

And as time unfolds its mysterious art,
May she find redemption, a brand-new start.
Let karma's echo resonate, a gentle knock,
Teaching her humility, in life's intricate clock.

   <h2>BETRAYAL IN POWER</h2>
		 <pre>
		  
BETRAYAL IN POWER
What truly matters? Do you care?
Your words were sweet, your tone so fair.
Yet now we watch your heart unfold,
Drunk on power, lifeless, cold.
You bathe in wealth, the people's sweat,
With lies so polished, no regret,
A promise made, a truth unmet.

You spoke of change, of better days,
Yet led us through a hollow maze.
The hungry wait, the jobless cry,
You watch them beg, then pass them by.
You sold us dreams, but gave us pain,
We wait for rain, yet burn in flame,
A cycle lost, yet all the same.

Your charm was false, your soul is bare,
A hollow man without a care.
We cheered you on, we called you ours,
Yet power crowned your heart with scars.
Now hear us scream, now see us break,
You rose so high, but still you ache—
A puppet bound, a grand mistake.

   <h2>SHATTERED REFLECTION:</h2>
		 <pre>
		  
Looked myself in the mirror and saw my reflection smiling
And all of a sudden dulled cause the true reflection is a shattered one swimming in pool of tears.  Pushed from shore to shore by it's strong sorrow Waves

When I'm alone in my head, all I have is
Cutthroat talk—
Dark and deep as the blue sea that drowns my peace,
Scattering my thoughts into different personalities.
What the heck?
Hope no one sees that in my reflection.
Yes, I'm strong, but torn between the current and the future.

But all you see is this picture—
Me, smiling, a million miles away from reality.
No more trolls. I'm done being strong.
I'm breaking—so I can be formed from the pieces of my wreck.
Yes, I'm Freyr Em, and to some, Willy M.
Paint that name hard on your wall,
And let it bleed red.

'Cause one day, it will be your daily leading light,
Taking you to all the heights
You tremble to write—
Because it seems wrong.
Now, warm your heart and let me halt all the hurts.

   <h2>CANCEL YOUR COUNSEL</h2>
		 <pre>
		  Cancel Your Counsel 
"How old is old enough to advise the old?
To add a vice in ways both odd and bold?
You think you guide, yet vices cling,
Trying to purify what you amplify—
Echoes of missteps tangled in your mind.

Every word you voice as truth,
Sneaks in, stained, and best left to youth.
Cancel your counsel; it taints the air—
You’re poison, unaware,
A voice unlearned, tangled, and uncouth.

Warm or cold, I could choose to receive,
But I turn deaf to lessons you conceive.
Your words ring hollow; you've never been wise—
I won’t heed the pretense or the guise.
An unstudied whisper that cannot deceive.

I heed no counsel, only my own—
In silence, I walk paths unknown.
For I am the master of my course,
Unmoved by echoes, by timid force.
My voice, my choice, till infinity."

		<h2>IN THE NAME WE SHARE </h2>
		<pre>
In love's tender arms, my spirit took flight,
Where laughter dances in the soft twilight.
With every heartbeat, the world feels so right,
Boundless affection, an eternal delight.

Through valleys of dreams, where stars ignite,
Our souls entwined, two hearts alight,
In your embrace, all worries take flight,
Love's pure essence, an endless height.

In whispers of breeze, our tale takes flight,
Eternal devotion, an unending sight,
In your eyes, a universe so bright,
Guided by love, through day and night.

		<h2>LOVE AT A, MILE </h2>
		<pre>
Through screens they spoke, FREY and RUTH hearts entwined,
Across the miles, their love undefined,
Texts flew swiftly, emotions refined,
In each typed word, affection enshrined.

"RUTH," she typed, __"this distance is unkind,
Yet in your messages, solace I find,
Each emoji you send, a love assigned,
Through pixels and bytes, our souls aligned."

"FREY," he replied, __"though we're confined,
Our love's a melody, perfectly designed,
In every text, our hearts combined,
Forever linked, our fates intertwined."

As days drifted by, their love didn't rescind,
Shared tales of dreams, hopes intertwined,

"Missing you, 
FREY," he messaged, __entwined,
"Counting minutes till our paths realign."

"Likewise, RUTH," __her text was lined,
"With every word, our bond refined,
Love's bridge across, our hearts defined,
Long-distance, yet our souls assigned."

	    <h2>HowTO LET GO:</h2>
		 <pre>
How to go about it, she doesn't know,  
She hates herself for feelings that flow.  
Letting emotions judge her soul,  
But deep down, she must take control.  
"I'm not wrong," she whispers, "I am strong,  
This feeling won't last; it won’t be long,  
In the end, I will be fine."  

Regrets will linger if she lets it slide,  
Words left unspoken will haunt her inside.  
But despite the weight of what she feels,  
She knows in her heart, time slowly heals.  
Though shadows may follow, she’ll find her light,  
Through every dark moment, she'll hold on tight,  
In the end, she will be fine.  

How to let it go when it's worth its weight,  
A treasure of feelings she fears to abate.  
With sparkling eyes now clouded by tears,  
She wonders if clarity ever appears.  
"Just take a sip from my cup," she pleads,  
If you can bear the bitter seeds,  
Then maybe you can part ways.  

It took her courage to finally speak,  
To own her emotions, not feel weak.  
"Take a sip from my cup, don’t be afraid,  
If you find my struggle, let it cascade,  
If you can face the pain and strife,  
Then you can understand my life,  
And perhaps we can part ways."  

In the end, it’s about finding peace,  
Navigating feelings, learning to release.  
Though it haunts her like a phantom's dance,  
She holds onto hope, embracing her chance.  
For every heartbreak leads to a spark,  
And in that light, she’ll leave her mark,  
Knowing one day, she will be fine.

     <h2>Close The door</h2>
		 <pre>
		     Close The door
Ain't boasting, but peace found me when you packed your bags,  
Boarded a bus, declaring an end to us with no more flags.  
You weren't just a nuisance; you endangered my mental health,  
A vampire, draining all my energy in pursuit of your stealth.

A labyrinth of headaches, navigating your every whim,  
Chasing circles, ending up in your ungrateful, toxic brim.  
Round after round, a chaotic maze of futile tries,  
Until finally, I saw your back, the door, your goodbyes.

Flames flickered as you departed, a finale so surreal,  
And my energy, once captive, now liberated to heal.  
Bursting free from the chains of your toxic grasp,  
In this newfound solitude, my strength began to clasp.

No longer entangled in the web of your disdain,  
In the aftermath, a symphony of liberation's refrain.  
Six stanzas echoing the triumph of letting you go,  
A tale of renewal, strength, and freedom's vibrant flow.

	 <h2> BLESSED SUNLIGHT</h2>
		 <pre>
As the sun rises, the Son lifts high,
Your glowing face mirrors the sky,
Reflecting love’s pure, golden tie,
In this haven where blessings lie,
A sacred bond our hearts rely.

This is it—the ground of grace,
A natural, holy, tender place,
Crafted by the Creator’s embrace,
To bless us both, as hearts interlace,
And souls in love’s rhythm trace.

I say thank you, my guiding light,
For in you, my heart finds might,
The woman whose love shines bright,
Who bore the blessing, day and night,
Making me whole—a father in sight.

   <h2>NOSTALGIA </h2>
		 <pre>
		  Last night,  
I couldn't sleep;  
I kept turning  
and thinking  
how calm and warming  
your touch felt  
on my skin  
beneath the sheets.

I wanted to cry,  
but my pillow was already soaked,  
and I couldn't shake off the shock  
that you are not coming back.  
I really tried to cry,  
but instead, I started to draw  
your image  
to ease the imagination.

I traced all the scars  
and all the curves,  
missing and admiring what I will never have.  
It felt awful  
roaming through the night like an owl,  
like a lost soul.

The home  
that you kept warm  
is now just a house,  
cold and silent  
without your presence.  
The past is making more sense  
because the present,  
without your presence,  
is more than absent.

*P.S.: What we had was real,  
but I guess good things don't last forever.*  
*That's why I'm binding you this farewell.*

   <h2>A LOVE IN TURMOIL</h2>
		 <pre>
Am I overdoing it, or is this your new way of luring?
I've been keenly analyzing,
Reading between the lines,
Trying all I can to see us as an item,
Swallowing pangs of pain,
Enduring your unbecoming.
The way you treat me feels toxic,
And compared to how we started, it’s shocking.

Was it a joke, or were you just exhausted after work
When you said, "I need actions, not just words"?
I've given attention, care, spoken your love language,
Loved you as if we just met,
Pure intimacy, no secrets—
As if we just wed.
But what are you holding back?
What’s stopping you from caring?

This is me, pouring my heart out,
Hoping together, we’ll work it out.
Don’t fight alone—
Come, lean on my shoulder.
Open up,
Shed light on the shadows in your heart,
Ignite the flames of love.
It’s cold to hold you in my arms
While your mind is miles away,
Hiding behind forced smiles,
Pretending you feel no guilt.

Love is a union, a fusion of emotions and feelings,
A rhythm of synchronized heartbeats.
Let’s find our rhythm, our sync.
In this dance of love, let’s never sink.

Reveal what’s hidden beneath your veiled eyes.
Let our love break through all the lies.
This is not a facade, not a mere show—
Let the authenticity of our bond glow.
Together, we’ll mend what’s torn apart,
Resurrect love from its dormant heart.

Trust in us, let it rise from the debris.
Reignite the passion that once set us free.
Embrace the truth, discard the disguise,
Let our love bloom, reaching for the skies.
In our union, let’s find our peace,
Love’s harmony—may it never cease.

   <h2>HEART ANGUISH </h2>
		 <pre>
		 

I wanted you so much,  
And when you realized, saw yourself in my eyes,  
From my point of view, you were an angel.  
But you started to cut me off from all angles,  
As if taking an L was not enough.  
You dragged my emotions, played rough with my feelings,  
Hurting was not your concern.  
You put me in a corner,  
Pouring out your cold heart just to hurt.

You knew it was you I was after,  
Even with your prolonged laughter.  
Whenever I mentioned my heart matters,  
You still were the one I was falling for.  
Your indifference cut deep, left scars,  
Making me question what we were.  
Yet I remained, hoping for change,  
Despite the pain you caused,  
Yearning for a love that never came.

Every cold word, every harsh tone,  
Only solidified the walls you'd grown.  
You showed no care for the tears I shed,  
Breaking me down with each word said.  
Still, I held on, to the dream of us,  
Ignoring the reality, avoiding the fuss.  
In my heart, you were always near,  
Despite the truth, despite the fear,  
I longed for the love you couldn’t give.

Now I see, clear as day,  
Your love was never meant to stay.  
The pain you caused has set me free,  
From the chains of a love that could never be.  
I'll mend my heart, find my peace,  
Let the anguish of loving you cease.  
For in the end, I learned to see,  
That the love I needed was within me.  
And in letting go, I found my harmony.
